Need to enumerate further: RID bruteforcing



We now have a list of users so will spray the known passwords against them








We can browse into c:\inetpub\wwwroot but can't write to any files. DEAD END

Looking at Program Files shows that Firefox is installed which is unusual so this needs to be examined


Downloaded full sysinternals suite on kali machine and then download procdump onto host







Need to examine the dump file


Alternate way to extract data


Now we have credentials we can use these to get an admin shell
